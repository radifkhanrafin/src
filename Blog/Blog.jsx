                        <p> <small>Ans :</small> PropTypes is a library included in React that enables typechecking of props passed to a React component. By using PropTypes, you can ensure that the props passed to your components are of the correct type, and help to prevent bugs caused by incorrect or missing prop values.</p>

                        <h3> <small>Q.2</small>  Tell us the difference between nodejs and express js.</h3>
                        <p> <small>Ans :</small> Developers describe ExpressJS as "Sinatra inspired web development framework for node.js -- insanely fast, flexible, and simple". Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications. On the other hand, Node.js is detailed as "A platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications". Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
                            <br />
                            1. ExpressJS belongs to "Microframeworks (Backend)" category of the tech stack, while Node.js can be primarily classified under "Frameworks (Full Stack)".
                            <br />
                            2. "Simple", "Node.js" and "Javascript" are the key factors why developers consider ExpressJS; whereas "Npm", "Javascript" and "Great libraries" are the primary reasons why Node.js is favored.
                            <br />

                            3. ExpressJS and Node.js are both open source tools. ExpressJS with 44.6K GitHub stars and 7.48K forks on GitHub appears to be more popular than Node.js with 35.5K GitHub stars and 7.78K GitHub forks.
                            <br />
                            4. According to the StackShare community, Node.js has a broader approval, being mentioned in 4104 company stacks & 4042 developers stacks; compared to ExpressJS, which is listed in 854 company stacks and 790 developer stacks</p>

                        <h3> <small>Q.3</small> What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?</h3>
                        <p> <small>Ans :</small> Custom React JS hooks are reusable functions that a React JS software developer can use to add special and unique functionality to the React applications. Usually, if there is a requirement to add a feature, one can install a third-party library and solve the problem. But what if there is no such library with hooks that can be used? This problem is solved by using custom React JS hooks.

                            A custom hook is a special JavaScript function whose name starts with ‘use’ and can be used to call other hooks. Let’s take a look at some major differences between a custom React JS hook and React JS components:

                            A custom hook does not require a specific signature.
                            A software developer can choose what argument the custom hook has and what should the argument return.
                            A custom hook always starts with the name ‘use’..</p>
